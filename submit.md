# Questions

#### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging piece of this assignment is to adjust many CSS styles and add many icons to make pages more professional. It's not easy to make everything harmonious. After finishing all pages, I spent another 3 hours changing the CSS of each page, as well as adding icons. The overall assignment took me 10 hours.

#### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

I need to make sure my navbar looks well on mobiles. I adjusted the font size of the navbar on mobiles according to the width of devices. Also, when displaying all the pictures in a grid on the interest page, I controlled the size of pictures. When debugging, I checked pages on many mobile devices to make sure everything looks well.

#### What did you take into account when you developed the *design* of your website? Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

I thought about the content on each page at the beginning. When coding, I tried to use a suitable format to display different pieces of information. To make my page more attractive, I downloaded and added many icons to my pages. I'm proud of my cute icons. I really love them.

#### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

I will design some interesting interactions for my pages. Besides, I prefer to add a page where others can leave their contact information, messages, suggestions, or a like to my site. These need the support of a database. Maybe I will add these in the future.

#### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

The overall assignment took me 10 hours. First, I spent 2 hours setting up a framework. Second, finishing the content of all pages took me 4.5 hours. Then, I spent 3 hours adjusting many CSS styles and adding many icons. At last, I spent half of an hour answering these questions.

# If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here. Furthermore, if you imported a file to use a Fonts or Icons library, please indicate that here as well.

I download several images from the Internet and use them as icons on my pages.
